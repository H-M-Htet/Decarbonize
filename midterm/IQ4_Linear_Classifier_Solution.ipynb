    "#### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which loss function gives better performance and why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, **Cross-Entropy loss gives better performance** for a classification task like this, and the results above should reflect that (though results can vary slightly due to random initialization). Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Nature of the Loss Calculation:**\n",
    "    *   **Multiclass SVM (Hinge) Loss:** The SVM loss aims to ensure that the score of the correct class is greater than the scores of all incorrect classes by a certain margin. Once this margin is achieved, the loss for that sample becomes zero. The model feels no incentive to further improve the scores, e.g., to make the correct class score *much* higher than the incorrect ones. It is satisfied as long as the separation is \"good enough.\"\n",
    "    *   **Cross-Entropy Loss:** This loss function is derived from the concept of maximizing the likelihood of the data. It uses the softmax function to convert raw scores into probabilities. The loss is the negative log-probability of the correct class. To make this loss very small, the probability of the correct class must approach 1, meaning its score must be significantly higher than all other scores. It *always* encourages the model to be more confident and produce a better probability distribution, never becoming fully \"satisfied.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Gradient Smoothness:**\n",
    "    *   The gradient of the Cross-Entropy loss is smooth and continuous, which often leads to more stable and straightforward optimization with gradient descent.\n",
    "    *   The SVM loss has a \"kink\" (it's not differentiable) at the point where the margin condition is met, which can sometimes make the optimization process slightly less stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Cross-Entropy loss is generally preferred for deep learning classification tasks because it pushes the model to produce well-calibrated probabilities and provides a smoother, more powerful optimization signal, often leading to higher accuracy."
